# Encore

## Pitch Deck Narrative

### About Me
hi! i’m nadine, a software engineer and creative technologist
passionate about shaping the future of music. throughout my journey,
i’ve had the privilege to collaborate with pioneering organizations
like nasa and amazon (aws), as well as visionary artists such as grimes
and vérité. these experiences have sharpened my understanding of
technology and how it can revolutionize creative expression.

in my free time, i’m working on developing algorhythm, a platform designed
to transform music discovery by uplifting independent artists.
alongside this, i share my thoughts on insights on the ever-evolving
music industry through a technological lens on my blog, reaching over
1,000 readers who share my passion for music, technology, and innovation.

### Problem
music discovery is now dominated by short-form video platforms
like tiktok and instagram reels, creating an oversaturated environment
where both labels and artists are locked in a constant battle
for fleeting attention. this race to achieve virality often leads
to temporary spikes in popularity, but these moments rarely
translate into lasting fan engagement, sustained ticket sales,
or long-term career development. consequently, artistry is
frequently overshadowed by those who can successfully game the algorithm.

### Solution
place an emphasis on prioritizing live shows, where fan commitment
and a musician’s revenue potential are most clearly demonstrated.
by focusing on artists who consistently sell out shows,
warner music group can identify those with genuine and dedicated
followings. this approach ensures that artists with proven live
engagement are recognized and supported.

### Market
live music is not just making a comeback—it’s booming. global revenues
are expected to reach $30 billion by 2025. in this revitalized market,
data-driven a&r is no longer just an advantage; it’s a necessity.
warner music group can strategically stay ahead of competitors by
leveraging data to identify artists who are consistently packing their shows.
this approach ensures investments are aligned with talent that connects with
audiences, driving immediate growth and ensuring sustainable long-term success.

### Product
encore is a tool designed to uncover the next big artist by focusing on
live performance success. it works by identifying musicians who have recently
performed at a sold-out show and features their profiles in a curated email.

**tech stack:** python, live music APIs

### Timeline
**plan:** during this initial phase, i’m focused on finalizing the project scope,
which involves selecting the right APIs for integration. this is critical,
as the tool’s performance hinges on the quality and reliability of
the data from these APIs. i am currently on the waitlist for the bandsintown API,
so i have begun exploring alternative options such as ticketmaster's API to avoid delays.

**develop:** during this phase, i’ll establish the development environment and
create a prototype script. this includes building the database, integrating
the selected APIs, and automating the email processes to ensure seamless operation.

**refine:** once development is complete, we’ll focus on refining the project
through thorough testing, collecting feedback from a&r professionals,
and implementing adjustments to enhance both functionality and performance.

**rollout:** finally, we’ll initiate a soft launch with a select group of a&r
professionals to assess early performance. once we’re confident in the results,
we’ll expand the deployment across the entire organization. additionally,
forming strategic partnerships with live music companies to secure exclusive insights
will be advantageous for the tool’s growth.

### Progress
as of august 23rd, 2024, i have successfully created a basic email script with test data.
up-to-date progress can be found on [github](https://github.com).

### Outcomes
encore’s long-term goal is to redefine artist signing by prioritizing the
success of live performances over transient social media trends. this strategy
will enhance warner music group’s ability to attract and retain talent with
proven fan engagement and long-term potential. by focusing on live performance
success, warner music group aims to maintain its leadership and relevance in
the evolving music industry.
