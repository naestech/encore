# Encore

## Pitch Deck Narrative

### About Me:
hi! i’m nadine, a software engineer and creative technologist passionate about shaping the future of music. i’ve had the privilege to work with pioneering organizations like nasa and amazon (aws), and collaborate with visionary artists such as grimes and vérité. these experiences have deepened my understanding of technology and how it can revolutionize creative expression.

currently, i’m developing algorhythm, a platform aimed at transforming music discovery by supporting independent artists. i also share insights on the evolving music industry through a technological lens on my blog, which reaches over 1,000 readers who share my passion for music, technology, and innovation.

### Problem:
music discovery is currently dominated by short-form video platforms like tiktok and instagram reels, resulting in an oversaturated market where labels and artists vie for fleeting attention. this quest for virality often leads to temporary spikes in popularity, but these moments seldom translate into lasting fan engagement, consistent ticket sales, or long-term career growth. as a result, genuine artistry can be overshadowed by those who adeptly game the algorithm.

### Solution:
emphasize live shows, where fan commitment and a musician’s revenue potential are most clearly demonstrated. by focusing on artists who consistently sell out their shows, warner music group can identify those with genuine and dedicated followings. this approach ensures that artists with proven live engagement receive the recognition and support they deserve.

### Market:
live music isn’t just making a comeback—it’s booming, with global revenues projected to exceed $30 billion by 2025. in this revitalized market, data-driven a&r is more than an advantage; it’s essential.

warner music group can stay ahead of competitors by leveraging data to identify artists who consistently sell out their shows. this approach aligns investments with talent that truly engages audiences, driving both immediate growth and long-term success.

### Product:
encore is a tool designed to uncover the next big artist by focusing on live performance success. it works by identifying musicians who have recently performed at a sold-out show and features their profiles in a curated email.

**Tech Stack:** python, live music apis, smtp and mime

### Timeline:
- **Plan:** in this initial phase, i’m focused on finalizing the project scope, including selecting the right APIs for integration. this is crucial, as the tool’s performance depends on the quality and reliability of the data from these APIs. i’m currently on the waitlist for the bandsintown API and am exploring alternatives like ticketmaster's API to prevent delays.
- **Develop:** in this phase, i’ll set up the development environment and create a prototype script. this includes building the database, integrating the selected APIs, and automating email processes to ensure smooth operation.
- **Refine:** once development is complete, we’ll refine the project by conducting thorough testing, gathering feedback from a&r professionals, and making necessary adjustments to improve functionality and performance.
- **Rollout:** we’ll start with a soft launch involving a select group of a&r professionals to evaluate early performance. once confident in the results, we’ll scale deployment across the entire organization. additionally, forming strategic partnerships with live music companies to gain exclusive insights will support the tool’s growth.

### Progress:
as of august 23rd, 2024, i’ve successfully created a basic email script with test data. up-to-date progress can be found on github.

### Outcomes:
encore’s long-term goal is to redefine artist signing by prioritizing live performance success over fleeting social media trends. this strategy will enhance warner music group’s ability to attract and retain talent with proven fan engagement and long-term potential. by focusing on live performance success, warner music group will continue to lead and remain relevant in the evolving music industry.
