## about me:
nadine: creative technologist and software engineer with a passion for shaping the future of music.

## problem:
- music discovery is dominated by social media, especially short-form platforms like tiktok and instagram.
- labels are competing in the same crowded space, leading to over-saturation.
- virality on social media doesn’t always lead to ticket sales or long-term success.

---

## solution:
- focus on concerts: live music is a strong indicator of an artist’s real fan base and revenue potential.
- encore identifies artists who are selling out shows and puts them on warner music group's radar.

- strategic advantage: by focusing on artists who have proven their fan engagement through sold-out shows, warner can stay ahead of competitors who rely solely on social media trends.
