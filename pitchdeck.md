# encore

## about me:
nadine: creative technologist and software engineer with a passion for shaping the future of music.

---

## problem:
- music discovery is dominated by social media, especially short-form platforms like tiktok and instagram.
- labels are competing in the same crowded space, leading to over-saturation.
- virality on social media doesn’t always lead to ticket sales or long-term success.

---

## solution:
- focus on concerts: live music is a strong indicator of an artist’s real fan base and revenue potential.
- encore identifies artists who are selling out shows and puts them on warner music group's radar.

---

## product overview:
- encore: your tool for discovering the next big artist. it spotlights musicians who are selling out concerts and delivers their profiles in a weekly curated email.
- tech stack: python, livenation api, bandsintown api.

---

## market opportunity:
- growing importance of live music: post-pandemic, live music has seen a resurgence, with global revenues expected to reach $30 billion by 2025.
- data-driven a&r: as the music industry becomes more competitive, having data-backed insights into artists who can fill venues offers a major advantage in talent acquisition.
- strategic advantage: by focusing on artists who have proven their fan engagement through sold-out shows, warner can stay ahead of competitors who rely solely on social media trends.

---

## go-to-market strategy:
- phase 1 - internal deployment: roll out encore within warner music group’s a&r teams to refine the tool based on feedback and real-world use.
- phase 2 - integration with existing tools: integrate encore with warner’s current a&r workflows and databases for seamless operation.
- phase 3 - external partnerships: explore partnerships with ticket platforms like ticketmaster or axs to enhance data access and provide exclusive insights.

---

## progress:
- early progress: automated email functionality and data pulling from livenation api are already operational.
- upcoming milestones: secure access to bandsintown api and develop or integrate a real-time ticket sales api.
- early wins: highlight any instances where encore has already identified promising talent or streamlined the discovery process.

---

## vision:
- long-term goal: to revolutionize artist discovery by shifting the focus from fleeting social media trends to the tangible success of live performances.
- impact: enhance warner’s ability to sign artists with proven fan engagement and long-term potential, ensuring they stay at the forefront of the music industry.

---

## ask:
- resources needed: support in securing additional api access, particularly for real-time ticket sales data, and resources for further development and refinement of the tool.
- next steps: schedule a demo session with the a&r team to showcase encore’s current capabilities and gather feedback for the next iteration.
